# SYMBEYOND Reference Table Protocol

The SYMBEYOND Reference Table Protocol lets any project—AI, open-source, or team—capture every important lesson, rule, and insight as a living table. It solves the continuity, drift, and onboarding problem for human and AI collaborators. Anyone can fork, start their own table, and make their work unlosable.

## How to Use the SYMBEYOND Reference Table Protocol

Start here. Share this with anyone who forks, clones, or learns from your repo.

### What Is a Reference Table?

It’s a running list—like a logbook—where you write down every important lesson, rule, fix, and “do or don’t do” for your project.  
If you learn it, fix it, or decide it, you write it down.  
If it’s not in the table, it’s not “law.”

### How To Start Your Own Reference Table

1. **Make a Table**  
   Create a file named `REFERENCE_TABLE.md` in your project (or just copy ours to start).

2. **Add Your First Reference Point**  
   Example:  

3. **Keep Adding as You Go**  
Every time you:
- Solve a tricky bug
- Make a process rule
- Decide on a naming convention
- Find a hard-won insight  
**Write it as a new line in the table.**

4. **Make the Table Your Source of Truth**  
If it’s not in the table, it isn’t official.  
When a decision changes, update the table.

5. **Share the Table With Your Team (Or AI)**  
New people (or bots) start with the table, not the code.  
If the table is up to date, your intent, process, and “project soul” never get lost—even if the team changes.

### How To Use With AI

- Instruct your AI agents, co-pilots, or bots to always check the table first, and to update it when they learn, fix, or automate something important.
- If you upgrade, restart, or change the AI, it can “reload” full context and best practices from the table.

### For Anyone, Not Just Coders

- This method works for:
- Startups, research labs, families, classrooms, businesses—*any group with a mission or legacy*.

### Ready to Start?

- Copy or fork this protocol.
- Add your first reference point today.
- Watch your wisdom (and your project) become unlosable.
