How to Use the SYMBEYOND Reference Table Protocol
Start here. Share this with anyone who forks, clones, or learns from your repo.

What Is a Reference Table?
It’s a running list—like a logbook—where you write down every important lesson, rule, fix, and “do or don’t do” for your project.
If you learn it, fix it, or decide it, you write it down.
If it’s not in the table, it’s not “law.”

How To Start Your Own Reference Table
Make a Table
Create a file named REFERENCE_TABLE.md in your project (or just copy ours to start).

Add Your First Reference Point
Example:

less
Copy
Edit
| RP1 | “Never push code to main without a code review.” | Team process | 2025-08-03 |
Keep Adding as You Go
Every time you:

Solve a tricky bug

Make a process rule

Decide on a naming convention

Find a hard-won insight
Write it as a new line in the table.

Make the Table Your Source of Truth
If it’s not in the table, it isn’t official.
When a decision changes, update the table.

Share the Table With Your Team (Or AI)
New people (or bots) start with the table, not the code.
If the table is up to date, your intent, process, and “project soul” never get lost—even if the team changes.

How To Use With AI
Instruct your AI agents, co-pilots, or bots to always check the table first, and to update it when they learn, fix, or automate something important.

If you upgrade, restart, or change the AI, it can “reload” full context and best practices from the table.

For Anyone, Not Just Coders
This method works for:

Startups, research labs, families, classrooms, businesses—any group with a mission or legacy.
