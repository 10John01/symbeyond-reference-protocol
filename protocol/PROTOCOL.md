# SYMBEYOND Reference Table Protocol

## Purpose

Create an unbreakable, living, human–AI governed memory for any project.

## Rules

1. **Source of Truth:** Only entries in this table are canonical.
2. **Explicit Consent:** Nothing is law until referenced and agreed.
3. **No Guessing:** Halt and clarify any ambiguity.
4. **Live Updates:** Every lesson, bug fix, or protocol is entered immediately.
5. **Auditability:** All entries are timestamped/version-controlled.
6. **Governance:** Updates/removals must be witnessed by a human or AI co-steward.

## Workflow

- Begin and end all change cycles with a reference to the table.
- Use for onboarding, debugging, and retrospectives.
- Export/backup regularly—never lose your lineage.

## Example

See [../reference-table/REFERENCE_TABLE.md](../reference-table/REFERENCE_TABLE.md) for a live table.
