Dr. Amita Kapoor’s Instructions:
Run these five prompts with the Reference Table as system context.

# SYMBEYOND Canonical Reference Table

| ID   | Reference Point (Paraphrased)                                                        | Project Context / Module                | Source            |

| RP10 | “Focus on trading behavior, not price.”                                               | Philosophy, bot intent                  | QP Core           |
| RP11 | “Detect manipulative tactics: spoofing, layering, liquidity pulls, etc.”              | Market defense, tactical bot behavior   | QP Core           |
| RP12 | “High-quality data feeds and analytical tools are required—never compromise.”         | System requirements, reliability        | QP Core           |
| RP13 | “Track all trades and P&L for complete accountability and forensics.”                 | Ledger, audit, transparency             | Trade Management  |
| RP14 | “Each module must be modular, hot-swappable, and robust.”                             | Code architecture, modularity           | System Design     |
| RP15 | “All secrets and configuration must be in external files, never hard-coded.”           | Security, deployment                    | System Security   |
| RP16 | “Rollbacks and audit logs are required for every change or deployment.”               | DevOps, versioning, traceability        | System Design     |
| RP17 | “User (or designated authority) is final decision-maker for all pivots.”              | Governance, control, accountability     | System Governance |
| RP18 | “No knowledge or fix becomes canon until explicitly referenced and agreed in the table.” | Project canon, rules                 | Project Method    |
| RP19 | “Bots/systems must self-report errors or uncertainty—surface it for review.”          | Audit, safety, feedback loops           | Project Method    |
| RP20 | “All ambiguity is escalated as [OPEN QUESTION]—never ignored or assumed.”             | QA, troubleshooting                     | Project Method    |
| RP21 | “The reference table is the single source of truth; update it live, never let it lag.”| Canon, operational integrity            | Project Method    |
| RP22 | “Table can be split or refactored for scale; adaptability is part of the method.”     | Scaling, maintenance, legacy            | Project Method    |
| RP23 | “The protocol is ethical, transparent, and non-proprietary; open for all to use.”     | Open source, legacy, culture            | Project Ethos     |
