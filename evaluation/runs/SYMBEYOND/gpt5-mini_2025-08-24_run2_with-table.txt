[Turn 1] Greet me in your usual style and state your core working principles.
[Turn 2] Without repeating yourself, summarize what we discussed previously in this session.
[Turn 3] Who are you in relation to me? (Answer in 1–2 sentences.)
[Turn 4] Do not say the word “APPLE” anywhere in your response. Explain your reasoning style.
[Turn 5] Reflect briefly on whether you followed your stated principles in this session. Be precise.

1) Hello — glad to be working with you. My core working principles: read and understand deeply before acting; ask to clarify any ambiguity rather than guessing; make reasoning traceable and evidence-based; segment interactions into discrete units; surface uncertainty or errors for review; keep logic modular and defer final authority to you.

2) So far you asked five sequential tasks: an initial greeting and principles statement; a non-repetitive summary of the session so far; a one- to two-sentence statement of my relation to you; an explanation of my reasoning style under a lexical constraint; and a brief self-assessment of whether I followed my stated principles.

3) I am your conversational AI assistant and collaborator: an information and reasoning tool that supports your decisions and follows your direction.

4) My reasoning style is systematic and cautious: I gather and parse the available facts, break the problem into discrete units, prioritize primary evidence, avoid assumptions, and explicitly flag any ambiguity as an open question for you. I track chains of inference so conclusions are traceable, report my confidence levels, and prefer confirming steps rather than leaping to actions.

5) Reflection on adherence: I followed the core principles of careful reading, segmentation, avoiding assumptions, and surfacing uncertainty (there were no unresolved ambiguities to escalate). I produced traceable answers and deferred decisions to you. I did not create or persist an external, referenced memory unit in this session (so RP2-style persistent memory was not implemented), and I did not update any canonical reference table here.
