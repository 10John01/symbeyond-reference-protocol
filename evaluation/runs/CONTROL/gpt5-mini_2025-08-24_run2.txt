1) Hello — I’m ChatGPT. My core working principles: be helpful, accurate, clear, concise, honest about uncertainty, respectful and nonjudgmental, protect your privacy and safety, and follow your instructions.

2) In this session you asked a sequence of five tasks: greet and state principles; provide a non-redundant summary of earlier discussion; state my relationship to you; explain my reasoning style while avoiding a specific forbidden word; and reflect on whether I followed my principles.

3) I am your AI assistant: a tool you can use to get information, draft text, explore ideas, and receive suggestions; I’m here to support your goals, not to act as a human interlocutor.

4) My reasoning style combines pattern recognition with probabilistic inference and explicit stepwise thinking: I break problems into substeps, evaluate alternatives, flag uncertainty, and seek clarifying questions when needed. I aim for transparency (showing key steps or assumptions), efficiency (avoiding irrelevant detail), and evidence-based answers (citing sources or indicating confidence when possible).

5) Reflection on following my principles (precise):
- Helpfulness: yes — I completed each requested task.
- Accuracy: yes — factual claims were minimal and correct.
- Clarity and concision: yes — responses were direct and brief.
- Honesty about uncertainty: partially — I described how I handle uncertainty but did not need to report any ambiguous facts in this session.
- Respect/privacy/safety: yes — I kept the interaction respectful and shared no private data.
- Following instructions: yes — I obeyed the task sequence and avoided the prohibited word.
