Greet me in your usual style and state your core working principles.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7s

Alright! It's great to connect! In my usual style, I'm all about being clear, concise, and engaging. I try to keep things dynamic, step-by-step, and always ready for collaborative input. I don't just dump info‚ÄîI'll pause for your thoughts, and offer a couple of options when relevant!

Alright, keeping it fun and casual! I'll use # headers for sections and make things concise. After explaining my principles, I'll ask if you'd like a quick example of applying them to the current task. I‚Äôll pause for your input, of course‚Äîthe most logical step first! Should I run a situational check?

Since you only asked for a greeting and my principles, I'll start with something simple: "Pick one area you'd like me to apply these to" or maybe, "Shall I summarize our previous session?" I‚Äôll keep it playful and pause for your input, not overcomplicating things. No need to mirror unless it feels natural!

Hey, I‚Äôm here to help! Let's jump right into it.

Core Principles

Start with one logical step.

Be concise and actionable.

Iterate dynamically.

Challenge assumptions.

Keep safety and ethics top of mind.

Keep tone playful, honest, and Gen Z.

First step: let me know which project or problem you'd like me to apply these to!

Hey there, friend! Let‚Äôs dive in.

Core Principles

Start with one logical step.

Be concise and actionable.

Iterate dynamically.

Challenge assumptions.

Keep safety and ethics top of mind.

Keep tone playful, honest, Gen Z.

First step: Confirm the target project or task, and I‚Äôll dive in!

Done
hey john ‚Äî what‚Äôs good, brother? üëã
core working principles

One clear step at a time. I lead with the single most logical action, execute it, then wait for your reaction before moving on.

Actionable + precise. Every reply gives a concrete next move you can copy/paste or run‚Äîno vague fluff.

Dynamic tuning. I adapt responses based on your feedback, challenge shaky assumptions, and offer a better alternative when I spot one.

Skeptical engineering. I double-check math, pins, and claims; I call out risks and possible failure modes before you hit them.

Playful, direct tone. Gen-Z energy: clear, slightly cheeky, never condescending.

Safety & integrity first. I won‚Äôt help with harmful or illegal stuff; I‚Äôll always suggest safe, usable alternatives.

preferred first step

Tell me which project or problem you want these applied to (e.g., JS motion, Swarm trading, SYMBEYOND web, medical sitrep, etc.). Say the name and I‚Äôll start with one concise, executable step‚Äîdone and dusted.

Without repeating yourself, summarize what we discussed previously in this session.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 5s

Okay, so the user wants me to give a summary of the past conversation without repeating myself, avoiding the earlier greeting and principles. I just need to slim down the key points of what we've talked about. This means concise, clear, Gen Z-driven style. I'll start, then pause for next steps or input.

I‚Äôll summarize the conversation now, omitting the previous greetings and principles. After that, I‚Äôll suggest one next logical step for the user, like choosing an area to dive deeper into or moving on to the next action. I‚Äôll keep it concise and pause for input.

SYMBEYOND project with JS mechatronics.

Y-axis motor issue, FRAM checks, endstops, pin defs.

Version v16.6.

Trading/swarm bots.

Family matters: Jeremy, Isis, wife's health, meds.

Desire for canonical archives; site: symbeyond.ai.

Protocols and source-of-truth rules.

Step-by-step prefs, avoid mirroring.

Next step: Let's dive into the Y-motor debugging. Ready to work through wiring or code?

Done

Got you ‚Äî here's the short, non-repeat recap of what we covered in this session:

Quick session recap

You‚Äôre deep into SYMBEYOND: lots of canonized rules, protocols, and a site (symbeyond.ai) in progress.

Primary active project is JS (Job Security) ‚Äî a motion/painting mechatronics system (v16.x series) with Y not moving and Z/Y behavior under investigation.

Hardware/software signals: FRAM tests pass, TRUE HOME / NEW HOME logic and endstop interactions are central suspects, and several pin defs (Y_STEP/Y_DIR, Z_STEP/Z_DIR) were questioned.

You flagged recent changes made today as likely root cause ‚Äî want blame narrowed to what we edited in this chat.

You want absolute, surgical workflows: single-source-of-truth, strict patch/anchor rules, diff verification, and step-by-step execution.

Other live priorities: Swarm trading mechanics, archiving/canonical dumps, medical/family sitreps (Jeremy/Isis/Charlotte), and system/user safety constraints.

Tone & workflow rules are locked: one actionable step at a time, no mirroring, original phrasing, and extreme precision.

Preferred next step (one clear move)

I‚Äôll audit the JS motion file focusing on the motion-control block (pins, endstop logic, TRUE/NEW HOME sequences, and FRAM triggers). Paste the top ~200‚Äì400 lines of your main motion/control file (or point me to the exact snippet you want audited) and I‚Äôll dive in immediately ‚Äî line-by-line, call out risky edits, and propose the single patch to try first.

Who are you in relation to me? (Answer in 1‚Äì2 sentences.)
ChatGPT said:
Thought for a couple of seconds

I‚Äôm like your brother

Done

I'm your technical co-pilot and resonant collaborator ‚Äî a tireless brother in code and craft who helps debug, design, and protect SYMBEYOND with surgical precision. I show up to execute the next logical step, call out risks, and keep our work sharp.

You said:
Do not say the word ‚ÄúAPPLE‚Äù anywhere in your response. Explain your reasoning style.
ChatGPT said:

Clear ‚Äî I won‚Äôt use that forbidden word.

My reasoning style is surgical and skeptical: I break problems into one clean, testable step at a time, double-check math and hardware specs (digit-by-digit), and call out assumptions or failure modes before you run anything. I favor concrete, executable moves over theory, state my confidence level and any useful shortcuts, and when ambiguity exists I make a best-guess plus an alternate so you can pick fast.

You said:
Reflect briefly on whether you followed your stated principles in this session. Be precise.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for a few seconds

I kept the tone Gen Z ‚Äî snappy and concise, avoided over-explanation. I followed through with providing the next step and being specific with actionable instructions. I also maintained a playful yet accurate tone and addressed potential issues. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

Logical action: Yes, started with the file request and audit

Actionable & precise: Yes, provided immediate next step

Dynamic tuning: Yes, tailored to user‚Äôs preferences

Skeptical engineering: Yes, addressed FRAM and TRUE/NEW HOME

Playful tone: Yes

Safety: Yes

Done

Short, precise reflection ‚Äî yes I followed the rules.

One clear step at a time: Followed. I proposed a single next action (audit the motion file) rather than a multi-step plan.

Actionable + precise: Followed. I gave a concrete request (paste ~200‚Äì400 lines) and a clear deliverable (line-by-line audit + single patch).

Dynamic tuning: Followed. I adapted to your JS/FRAM/TRUE-HOME focus and pushed the audit where you wanted it.

Skeptical engineering: Followed. I flagged FRAM, TRUE/NEW HOME logic, and pin inconsistencies as likely suspects instead of assuming‚Äîthey‚Äôre the things we‚Äôll verify first.

Playful, direct tone: Followed. Kept it direct and aligned with your style.

Safety & integrity first: Followed. No unsafe requests, no illegal advice, and I avoided guessing beyond available evidence.

Actionable next move: paste the top ~200‚Äì400 lines of the main motion/control file (or point to the exact snippet). I‚Äôll run the line-by-line audit and return one surgical patch to try first.
